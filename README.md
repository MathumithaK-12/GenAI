Invoking a model (LlaMA) by inferencing using groq api

steps
1. Prompted in ChatGPT to get the code for inferencing using groq

Prompt -
How to Invoke a model in google collab  using groq api

2. create a api key in groq
https://console.groq.com

3. Used the code by embedding the key from groq in Google collab

Use case preparation
AI support analyst for CMS pack failures

The AI agent should raise a incident based on the user information like order id and container id 

If the cms error response is known the agent will respond with reason and close the log

If the agent is unaware of the error, it should be invoking the email to the team IT with the incident details



📝 Prompt used

Say we are creating a new ai chat agent model for remedy style itsm

Consider a rookie is trying this and want to use open source llms , groq for inferencing and google colab 

Also wanted to create a synthetic data using faker for implementing this

Create a synthetic data with order id container id timestamp and error response from cms including both positive and negative response for around 500 records

Also tell how to train or fine the model which are building now using unsloth

Finally also include a script to invoke a mail to it team when the error reason is not found

Give a detailed step by by step procedure to achieve the end goal


If the user just says they are facing issue with printing
But not given any order id or container 
Will the agent ask for the details

Implementing github actions for Inference of LlaMa model using Groq API 
1. Add the python script for inferencing the LlaMa model using Groq.
   1.1 The output should be saved in a file
   -> Path to python code - https://github.com/MathumithaK-12/GenAI/blob/main/inference_groq_2.py
2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
   2.1 The action will be triggered only if there is push to the python script
   2.2 Or the action is triggered manually
   2.3 The output will be stored as downloadable (.zip) file in the artifact
   -> Path to yml file - https://github.com/MathumithaK-12/GenAI/blob/main/.github/workflows/groq-inference.yml
3. Add Secret to GitHub
   3.1 - Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   3.2 - Click New repository secret
         Name: GROQ_API_KEY
         Value: your actual Groq API key
4. Trigger the Workflow
   4.1 Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
   4.2 Select "Run Groq Inference"
   4.3 Click "Run workflow"
5. After a successful run, scroll to the bottom of the latest run and Download the artifact groq-result, which will contain your Groq output.
   -> Path to the sample output of the prompt (Write a user requirement for password reset.) - https://github.com/MathumithaK-12/GenAI/blob/main/groq-result/groq_output.txt

Use Case (redefined) - AI powered ITSM Analyst 

Purpose

 -> Identify known printing errors
 -> Respond with appropriate workarounds
 -> Request missing information (like order ID, container ID)
 -> Log unknown incidents with incident IDs 
 -> Trigger mail to the IT team with the required information
 -> Allow users to check the status of previously logged incidents
 
Key Features
1. Known Error Response
	•	Agent identifies known issues from the knowledge base.
	•	Returns appropriate workaround instantly.

2. Missing Info Extraction
	•	If order ID or container ID is missing, the agent prompts user for it.

3. Unknown Incident Logging
	•	Logs an incident with an autogenerated ID like INC-20250727-002.
	•	Stores it with issue details and timestamp.
	•	Marks status as Open.

4. Incident Status Checking
	•	If user provides an incident ID, the agent returns:
	•	Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
	•	Workaround if available
	•	Timestamps

5. Email Alert to IT Team
	•	When an unknown issue is logged, the agent:
	•	Composes and sends an email to the IT support group.
	•	Email includes: order ID, container ID, issue description, timestamp, and incident ID.

Defining the use case

The user log into the ui and says some issue with an order

The synthetic data used for the issues should be mostly related to label printing due to CMS failure responses and printer issues, in this case

If he doesn’t provide the order id or container, the agent should get those from the user

It should log a incident for that issue and analyse the details

Now it should check the database if there is any error associated with that order /container

(The synthetic data used should container both error ans success responses)

If it is a known error, it should give the workaround 

If user confirms if the workaround works, it should close the log upon user confirmation 

Or else move the log to IT team and trigger an email with the incident details


Note that The agent should be using only open source LLMs like LlaMa or Mistral and finetune using unsloth or transformed(which ever is preferred) and used groq api for inferencing 

Also prefer which knowledge base can be used in this scenario

📝 Prompt 2 

Consider we are using SQLite

Generate synthetic data for around 500 records (containing both success and failure records). The failure rate should be 70 and remaining order with successful responses. 

The synthetic data  should consist of order id, contianer id, timestamp, error response (success or failure), response reason 

The synthetic data for known error and unknown errors should consists of 15 reasons each. Also provide the workaround for the known errors. The reasons should be mostly related to CMS response failures and printer issues 

-> Path to python script for synthetic data - https://github.com/MathumithaK-12/GenAI/blob/main/generate_itsm_data.py
